# Social Signup Technical

A page designed to match the technical assessment requirements of building an RSS Feed Reader using HTML and CSS. 

## Overview

There is a live example of the page running here (http://socialsignin.powerloop.co.uk/rsa.html)

This running example is based on the BBC list of feeds and will add BBC Technology and BBC Sc-Tech if no other feeds are found in local storage.

The gridwork and cards are now styled using flexbox rather than the masonry.js library.

As feeds are added and removoed they are added and removed from the active screen.

## Outstanding

The Filter feature is not active yet.

## Lirarys Used

### date.js (http://www.datejs.com/)

DateJs is a handy library I have used to assist in the date format for speed!
